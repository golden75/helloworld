<h3><a id="Xanadu_1"></a><span style="color: #0000ff">What is a cluster</span></h3>
A desktop or a laptop, in most cases, is inadequate for analysis of large scale datasets (e.g. Genomics) or to run simulations (e.g. protein docking).  They lack both the processing power and the memory to execute these analyses. This limitation can be overcome by combining machines (computers) in a predefined architecture/configuration so that they act as a single unit with enhanced computational power and shared resources.  This is the basic concept of a high performance cluster.  A cluster consists of a set connected computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system. Each computer unit in a cluster is referred as ‘node’.
